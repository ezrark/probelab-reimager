# Probelab-ReImager
This is the backend module and command line version for Probelab-ReImager. Most options are available via cli but more
control is offered through the module interface.

Iconv-lite no longer needed, pre-compressed version only supporting win1251 for JEOL files included. This reduces
dependency size by ~400kb minified.

Full PFE MDB support has been added for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Windows uses the provided driver and MacOS/Linux uses
[mdb-sql](https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools)

-t, --ontop                                     Sets the scale bar on top of the scale value
-i, --points                                    Prints points onto image
-p, --position [pos]                            Position to print the scale
-c, --color [color]                             Scale color
-b, --background [color]                        'Below' or if 'opaque', background color
-o, --opacity [0-100]                           Opacity of the background for the scale (default 0)
-s, --scale [Âµm]                                Scale to display, < 1 for auto
-k, --barheight [0-100]                         Set scale bar to a % of the text font height, < 1 for auto(8)
-x, --pixelsize [num]                           Sets the pixel size constant for the probe calibration equation
-n, --pointtype [pointType]                     Sets the type used to define points (Only over 128 res)
-e, --textcolor [textColor]                     Sets the color to display the point names in
-z, --textsize [num]                            Sets the font size for the point names
-d, --pointsize [num]                           Sets the point size
-f, --font [font]                               Sets the font to use
-a, --acq                                       Exports an ACQ file alongside the image (Forced jpg output)
-l, --layer [layerName, [color, opacity]]       Tries to overlay the layer, when > 1, added in order

Pixel Size Constant:
        Default: 116.73
Default was with the UMN Probelab's JEOL JAX 8530F Plus and is the constant of the calibration curve.
The calibration curve seems to always be CONST*x^(-1) or close enough to it for scale estimations.

Colors (Scale and Background):
a, auto         Selects the color automatically
b, black

Colors (Text):
a, auto         Selects the color automatically

Colors (Layers)

br, belowright          Scale is Under the image, Right
bc, belowcenter         Scale is Under the image, Centered
ul, upperleft           Scale is in the Upper Left
ur, upperright          Scale is in the Upper Right
